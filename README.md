## Learning Points

The development of this Weather Dashboard provided several learning points for me in a coding bootcamp. Some key takeaways include:
1.	HTML Structure: Learn about structuring a web page using HTML tags and elements. They can understand the importance of semantic HTML and how to organize content effectively.
2.	Responsive Design: By utilizing the Bootstrap framework, you can gain knowledge about creating responsive web designs. You can understand how to use Bootstrap's grid system, components, and utility classes to ensure the page adapts well to different screen sizes.
3.	JavaScript Functionality: Implement JavaScript code to add dynamic behavior to the page. You can learn about DOM manipulation, event handling, and making API requests to retrieve weather data from external sources.
4.	API Integration: By incorporating the OpenWeather API, you can learn how to work with third-party APIs to fetch data and integrate it into their web applications, understand the concept of making HTTP requests, handling responses, and parsing JSON data.
5.	Local Storage: Explore the use of browser's local storage to store and retrieve search history. learn how to store data persistently on the user's device and utilize it to enhance the user experience.
